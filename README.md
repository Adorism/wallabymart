# Wallabymart

I put this simple Grouparoo project together to demonstrate the application in the context of an interview process. 

- Step 1: Create a CSV of fake user data using a Python script
- Step 2: Import the CSV to a Postgres database
- Step 3: Configure Grouparoo to use Postgres as a source and HubSpot as a destination
- Step 4: Run Grouparoo. I monitored this job and observed that the 1000 simple account records took approximately 15 minutes for migration.
